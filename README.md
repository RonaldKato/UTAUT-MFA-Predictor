# 🔐 UTAUT MFA Predictor

Predicting the Future of Digital Trust in Uganda's Financial Sector — One Model at a Time

## 🧠 Overview

The **UTAUT MFA Predictor** is a research-driven machine learning project designed to model and predict the **adoption of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** among users of financial services in Uganda. Grounded in the **Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)** framework, this tool leverages insights from the **FinScope Uganda 2023 survey** to support digital security decisions that are both user-centered and scalable.

Whether you're a researcher, financial service provider, or policy-maker, this repository offers actionable insights on factors influencing MFA adoption, bridging the gap between **theory and implementation**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📊 **Model** MFA adoption based on UTAUT constructs: Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and Facilitating Conditions.
- 🤖 **Train & evaluate** multiple machine learning algorithms for predictive accuracy.
- 🌍 **Analyze** demographic and behavioral variables (e.g., location, education, trust levels).
- 🛡️ **Enhance** digital security policies and UX design for authentication systems.
